##Insperation##
One inspiration for this project was the classic Pink Floyd cover art for Dark Side of the Moon.
It is a simple display of dispersion of light.
A small beam of light hits a prism and is divided into a rainbow of colored lights.
This lead us to also investigate what causes rainbows and how we could simulate it.

To recreate the album cover we needed to do two things.
The first is to implement the physical phenomenon of dispersion, to split a white light ray into several monochromatic light rays of different colors.
The other thing is to visualize the light path using volumetric rendering, otherwise we would only to be able to see the light when it hits a surface.
PBRT has some support for this but it needs to be extended somewhat.

##Photonvolume integrator##
For this part we expand on two sections in PBRT.
We will use the the volumetric rendering integrator "single" and the surface integrator "photonmap".
Combining these two integrators we get the result in figure 3. 
The volumetric renderer produces the desired result until it hits the sphere.
After that the photonmap surface integrator uses its stored photon data to render where the light ends up on the floor.
What we lack is the volumetric scattering between the sphere and the floor.

This part of the project have been heavily inspired by several previous projects in this course, especially [5] and implemented algorithms from [3].
In PBRT only the photomap surface integrator uses photons and a lot of the photon shooting process is in that class.
This part was extracted from the class and into a new class called "photonShoter".
The photonShooter produces and stores the photons.
This was done so both the surface and volume integrator can have easy access to the stored photons and that not one of them is responsible for shooting the photons.
The photon shooting task was extended to not only store caustic, indirect and radiance photons but also volume photons.

Now say something about the algorithm... blah blah blah

Figure 4 shows the result, notice the volumetric caustic effect created by the sphere.

##Dispersion##
There are three things that were implemented to create dispersion: 

 - Split white light rays into multiple monochromatic light rays.
 - Create materials that can determine the level of dispersion.
 - Refract rays at different angles depending on the wavelength of the light ray.
 
The first was done by extending the Spectrum class.
We added a member variable that stores the spectrum wavelength if it is monochromatic.
We also added a simple function that creates multiple spectrum from one and stores it in a vector.
These two simple additions made it possible to split non-monochromatic light (of any color) into multiple monochromatic rays.

The second implantation was in the glass material class.
We added a member variable that stores the V-number (or Abbe number) from user input.
Just as the user can set the index of refraction for the glass material we made it just at simple to add a V-number. 
The V-number defines how dispersive (how much the light splits) the material is.
Just as different types of glass have different index of refractions they also have different V-numbers, both determines how light is refracted and transmitted when it intersects the material.

The last implementation was to extend the SpecularTransmission class in reflection.h.
This part controls the angle of the new transmitted ray.
Before the angle depended on the indecies of refraction for the materials.
Now it must depend on both the wavelength of the light and the V-number of the material.
To determine the angle depending on the wavelength we used Cauchy's equation. It looks like this:

Where A and B is material dependent constants and l is the wavelength in micrometers and n is the index of refraction.
The definition of the V-number is this: 

We can use this definition to determine the A and B for the material like this:

Now, the equation for the new index of refraction becomes:

The result can be seen in the images below. In order from left to right these are: no dispersion, low dispersion (crown glass), high dispersion (flint glass), extreme dispersion (flint glass).
